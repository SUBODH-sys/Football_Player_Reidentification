# Football_Player_Reidentification
1. This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect, track, and re-identify players from a single static video feed, focusing on sports analytics. It uses a YOLOv8 model for detecting players and the ball, with DeepSort for tracking over time. Appearance embeddings generated by OSNet x1.0 enhance re-identification accuracy, especially in crowded or overlapping scenes.

2. To set up the environment, Python 3.8 or higher is required. Install the following dependencies: scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, opencv-python, torch, torchvision, deep_sort_realtime, and ultralytics. Ensure a YOLOv8 model checkpoint (best.pt) and a video file (15sec_input_720p.mp4) are placed in the same directory as the script. 

3. The program processes each video frame to detect and track players. Outputs is an annotated video (output.mp4). 

4. This solution is ideal for analyzing player activity in single-view sports videos. While effective, it faces limitations such as hardcoded thresholds and sensitivity to occlusions.
