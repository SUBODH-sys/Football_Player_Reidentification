# Football_Player_Reidentification
This project uses deep learning to detect, track, and re-identify players in a single static video feed for sports analytics. It employs YOLOv8 for detecting players and the ball, DeepSort for tracking, and OSNet x1.0 embeddings to improve re-identification accuracy in crowded or overlapping scenes.
